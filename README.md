## Tests

Tests is a folder containing 20 tests and shell scripts to translate and compile the tests.

## Project Files

The classes we created are in xtc/src/xtc/

## Project

The focus of our exploration of object-oriented programming is a translator from Java to C++. You design, implement, and evaluate your own translator as a term-long project, working in teams of four to five students. In fact, you build two versions of your translator, taking half a term for each version and presenting your work in class on completion of each version. To make the project manageable, your translator only translates a restricted subset of Java into an even more restricted subset of C++; though the second version covers more functionality than the first version. I also provide you with "helper" code, notably for parsing and pretty printing program source files.

Each group elects a speaker, who coordinates with the members of the group and with me. A new speaker is elected at the middle of the term.

Your group's midterm and final project presentations address three main issues:

    What are the design and implementation of your translator?
    How do you ensure that the translator meets the project requirements? Notably, how do you convince yourself and others that the translator actually works?
    What was easy, hard, and/or surprising and how did that impact your translator?

You have a 12 minute slot for your presentation, which includes a demo of your translator and time to set up your laptop.
